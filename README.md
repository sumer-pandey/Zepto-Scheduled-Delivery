## Background & Objective

Scheduled delivery is core to e-grocery giants, but a challenge for new entrants focused on instant delivery. This project investigates critical trust barriers, user habits, and operational tradeoffs in Zepto’s scheduled delivery feature, culminating in actionable insights for product teams, operators, and founders.

## Key Findings

- Only 20% of surveyed Zepto users adopt scheduled delivery; 80% stick with ASAP.
- Primary bottleneck: low trust in promise-keeping and poor slot visibility.
- Scheduled delivery, when optimized, reduces fulfillment cost by 30–40% and smooths operational strain.
- UX nudges, price incentives, and slot guarantees measurably increase slot selection and retention.

## Methodology

- Mixed-methods user research (N=40, segmented weekly buyers)
- Comparative feature benchmarking (Zepto vs BigBasket, Blinkit, Instamart, Amazon Fresh, Dunzo Daily)
- KPI trees, funnel breakdowns, risk/mitigation framing
- Rapid pilots: slot visibility nudges, first-slot fee waivers, live ETA guarantees

## Impact & Recommendations

Prioritize trust-building and slot clarity to unlock sustainable growth for Zepto’s scheduled model. Target high-LTV non-schedulers with UX, pricing, and operational incentives. This roadmap boosts unit economics, demand predictability, and long-term loyalty.
