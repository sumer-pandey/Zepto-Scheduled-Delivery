# Zepto Scheduled Delivery Product Analysis

_An analysis by Sumer Pandey – Top Fellow, NextLeap PM Fellowship, Cohort 37_

---

## Executive Summary

Scheduled delivery features have become essential in India's fast-commerce ecosystem, but widespread user adoption remains low due to trust barriers and habitual preferences for instant delivery. This project rigorously investigates Zepto’s scheduled delivery, benchmarking it against competitors, unpacking operational and user experience gaps, and recommending strategic interventions. The outcome: a clear action plan to unlock scheduled adoption, boost loyalty, and strengthen business sustainability in hyper-competitive quick commerce.

## Project Background

- **Objective**: To uncover why users hesitate to adopt scheduled delivery in Zepto, and provide actionable solutions for product, business, and operations teams.
- **Business Context**: Scheduled delivery has long powered traditional e-grocery giants like BigBasket and Amazon Fresh. Quick-commerce players like Zepto, Blinkit, and Instamart now add scheduled slots to drive operational efficiency, but adoption is inconsistent.
- **Report Structure**: Market landscape, detailed user research, methodologically-sound experiments, and a recommendations roadmap.

## Competitor & Market Analysis

| Competitor    | Scheduled Slot Availability | Positioning Highlights    | Typical Time Range |
|---------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| BigBasket     | Yes                        | Default model            | 2–3 hrs           |
| Dunzo Daily   | Yes                        | Checkout slot visibility | 1–2 hrs           |
| Blinkit       | Limited                    | Low in checkout flow     | N/A               |
| Instamart     | Limited                    | Piloting incentives      | N/A               |
| Amazon Fresh  | Yes                        | Trust via Prime          | 1–2 hrs           |

- **Scheduled Model**: E-grocery leaders default to scheduling. New quick-commerce players extend with scheduling features to reduce costs and smooth demand, but struggle to match trust and clarity.
- **Market Data**: E-grocery market at \$6-7B, 50-60% annual growth. Scheduled delivery cuts cost per order by 50-60% versus instant delivery, with 2x higher average order value in the segment[attached_file:1].

## Zepto’s Scheduled Delivery: Position & Challenges

- **USP**: 10-min instant delivery core to Zepto's brand.
- **New Feature**: Scheduled slots (e.g., 7–9 AM next day) for groceries, household essentials, and perishables.
- **Strategic Goal**: Shift demand to scheduled slots for margin and sustainability—without diluting the 10-min value proposition.

**Operational Advantages:**
- Batch orders, lower last-mile costs, improved inventory planning, better demand predictability, less ops surge.
  
**Key Challenge:**
- Only 20% of Zepto users utilize scheduled delivery; 80% stick with ASAP, citing unreliable timings and weak slot visibility.

---

## Methodology & Research Approach

- **Timeline**: May – August 2025, NextLeap PM Fellowship.
- **User Sample**: 40 Zepto users, with focus group follow-ups among weekly buyers (N=23) and non-schedulers (N=18).
- **Tools/Frameworks**: 
  - In-depth interviews (segmented)
  - Surveys
  - KPI tree breakdowns (see PDF)
  - Comparative analysis with industry leaders
  - Problem Framing / JTBD
  - Hypothesis-driven rapid pilots

---

## User Research Deep Dive

**Persona Targeted:** 
- Weekly buyers (4+ orders/month) who never use scheduled delivery.
- Pain Points: Strong ASAP habit, distrust of scheduled slot reliability, poor slot visibility, reluctance to pay extra, or lack of awareness.
  
**Barriers Found:**
- Trust in timely delivery is low (2.95/5) – the main limiter to likelihood of trying scheduled options.
- Additional friction: slot visibility in app is weak, slot granularity doesn't fit routines (pref. evenings).
- 40% are willing to pay a fee (\~₹30 median)[attached_file:1].

**Jobs-To-Be-Done ("JTBD"):**
- Need to be present for large items or perishables.
- Prefer pre-scheduled for busy mornings/evenings when at home.
- Want order predictability, avoid disruptions, minimize rescheduling friction.

---

## Key Insights & Findings

- **Adoption Opportunity:** 45% of weekly Zepto users (non-schedulers) are open to trialing scheduled delivery if trust, visibility, and perceived benefit improve.
- **Cost Impact:** Scheduled delivery reduces Zepto's fulfillment cost by 30–40% via batch operations and predictable demand.
- **Operational Takeaway:** Improving scheduled share in groceries, fruits, and dairy from baseline 20% to 30% would significantly reduce ops costs and increase loyalty.

## Pilot Experiments & Results

**1. Default Slot Suggestion (Awareness Intervention)**
   - Added UI tooltip suggesting a slot on PDP/cart.
   - **Metric:** Slot selection rate.
   - **Outcome:** 10 percentage point increase in users picking scheduled slots.

**2. Price Nudge**
   - Waived the ₹30 service fee for first scheduled order.
   - **Metric:** Scheduled conversion rate.
   - **Outcome:** 10 percentage point uplift vs. control.

**3. Slot Guarantee (Trust)**
   - Live ETA + ₹50 credit if late.
   - **Metric:** On-time rate, NPS improvement.
   - **Outcome:** 10–15 percentage point boost in on-time fulfillment rate.

## Recommendations & Roadmap

- Prioritize evening slots and clearer granularity for target customer routines.
- Push slot suggestions and price nudges for habitual ASAP users.
- Operationalize slot guarantee incentives in major city zones to build trust.
- Limit introductory offers to new/low-AOV users to avoid cannibalization.
- Improve app slot visibility with real-time indicators.
- Monitor and cap capacity to avoid overpromising (soft reservations).
- Expand persona-driven experimentation, sharing learnings across teams.

- Reducing operational costs through demand smoothing.
